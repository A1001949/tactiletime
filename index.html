				<h2>What Makes This a New Media</h2>
				<p>As a modular entity, this timepiece considers the inclusion of software, hardware, and 3D printing technologies. Through haptic expression, it can also be numerically represented by a factor of the time it represents. Tactile time is expressed automatically, using the platform's internal clock. However, such time is variably dependent on its changeable source code and its interactive interface. Its creation was ultimately influenced by the necessities of deaf-blind culture, and its usage influences the culture through the temporal independence it provides. In a world that is permeated with audio-ocularcentric media, Lev Manovich (2001) would undoubtedly consider this timepiece as a new media artifact.</p>

				<h2>External Casing</h2>
				<p>The external casing for this prototype is 3D printed using the MakerBot Replicator, hosted by UTSC’s Makerspace. The casing and strap are printed using PLA and TPU filaments. In order to model the casing, software such as Tinkercad was used. This product was modelled after the traditional wristwatch, as it is the most ergonomically friendly and recognizable interface for telling time. The timepiece is printed using black filament, which is the ironic amalgamation of all colours and shades that define visuality. Given most deaf-blind individuals depend on their hands to navigate and communicate, a tactile button is fashioned at the top of the piece. When the user wishes to tell the time, they can press the button using any free hand or any solid surface.</p>

				<h2>Internal Circuitry</h2>
				<p>Within this product, an Adafruit GEMMA M0 is used as the prototype’s microcontroller. Additionally, a miniature vibrating motor is necessary in order for the timepiece to express the current time. This timepiece is also fashioned with a lithium ion polymer battery for its lightweight and compact power. Since the prototype does not require energy for a digital display or audio, the battery is able to run for days without needing a recharge. To activate the timepiece, a tactile switch is also connected to the microcontroller. When pressed, the switch will send a send a signal to the microcontroller, and the microcontroller will send a signal to the motor to vibrate the tactile time. Additional diodes, resistors, and transistors are necessary for the microcontroller to communicate with the vibrating motor. </p>

				<h2>Telling Tactile Time</h2>
				<p>This prototype focusses on the durational aspects of tactility. More specifically, the tactile timepiece conveys time as a function of Morse code. Historically, Morse code was used by the electrical telegraph in conveying textual information across space, near instantaneously. As such, the electrical telegraph was a response to the human disability of conveying information across large areas of space. Historically, the development of temporal technologies was in response to the human impairment of accurately assessing time. Arguably, any new media development is a response to social and cultural human impairments. This prototype is no different.</p>

				<h2>Setting Tactile Time</h2>
				<p>For the purposes of this project, the some settings can be updated directly in the source code. In future iterations of this prototype, it would be ideal if theses settings can be changed directly through the timepiece. 
				<br>
				For now, simply set the variable to the current time in 24 hour, HH:MM format.</p>
			</div>
			<image id="currenttime" src="./img/currenttime.jpg"/>
			<div class="center">
				<p>This timepiece has alarm functionality as well! 
				<br>
				Simply set the variable to the desired alarm time, and turn the alarm on by setting the next variable to True.</p>
			</div>
			<image id="alarm" src="./img/alarm.jpg"/>
			<div class="center">
				<p>Sometimes, telling tactile time may be difficult. 
				<br>
				To add a small buffer in between vibrations, simply change the variable (in seconds) to a number between 0 and 0.5.</p>
